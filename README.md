# October 2008 It all started with Satoshi Nakamoto and his paper [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) 
which addressed a key problem in electronic commerce:
~~~
A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly 
from one party to another without going through a financial institution. 

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party 
is still required to prevent double-spending.

We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.

# BitCoin and Blockchain

* Assets over cryptocurrency
* Identity over anonymity
* Selective endorsement (consensus) over proof of work

# Blockchain Use cases

# Blockchain and Hyperledger
~~~
Hyperledger, an open source collaborative effort to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies, 
is hosted by The Linux Foundation®. 

IBM provides blockchain solutions and services leveraging Hyperledger technologies, 
including Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer.
